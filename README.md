# Vehicle Data Collection Program
I created a simple Java program to keep track of vehicle data. This program serves as more efficient way to keep records for the vehicles I work on, especially after I lost a piece of paper containing important information about each vehicle I maintained. The program is straightforward, as it prompts users for details such as the vehicle's year, make, and model, along with any additional information they wish to provide, and stores the users input into a file by writing to the file using Java's FileWriter.
